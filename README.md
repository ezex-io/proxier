# Proxier

**Proxier** is a high-performance **reverse proxy** that routes external requests to predefined origin servers.
It is lightweight, configurable via `config.yaml`, and supports multiple endpoints.

## üöÄ Features
- üåç **Dynamic Proxy Routing** ‚Äì Easily define multiple proxy rules in `config.yaml`
- üõ† **Simple Configuration** ‚Äì No database required, just YAML-based settings
- üöÄ **Fast & Efficient** ‚Äì Optimized request forwarding
- üèó **Cross-Platform** ‚Äì Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Here‚Äôs an improved and clarified version of your README section to reflect the current configuration via **environment variables**, including formatting, examples, and explanation:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The proxy server can be configured using **environment variables**. Here's a breakdown of the supported variables:

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables

| Variable Name                  | Description                                                                    | Example           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `PROXIER_ADDRESS`         | Host and port for the proxy server to bind to                                  | `127.0.0.1:8081`  |
| `PROXIER_ENABLE_FASTHTTP` | Enable [`fasthttp`](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) instead of `net/http` | `true` or `false` |
| `PROXIER_RULES`     | Comma-separated list of proxy rules in \`key                                   | `[{"endpoint":"/foo","destination":"https://httpbin.org/get"}, {"endpoint":"/bar","destination":"https://google.com"}]` |

* **key**: The path endpoint to intercept (e.g., `/foo`)
* **val**: The destination URL to which the request should be proxied

### üîÅ Example

```env
PROXIER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:8081
PROXIER_ENABLE_FASTHTTP=false
PROXIER_RULES=[{"endpoint":"/foo","destination":"https://httpbin.org/get"}, {"endpoint":"/bar","destination":"https://google.com"}]
```

This setup creates the following proxy routes:

| Endpoint | Proxies To                |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| `/foo`   | `https://httpbin.org/get` |
| `/bar`   | `https://google.com`      |
